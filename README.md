# Audion

Audion is a Chrome extension that adds a Web Audio panel to dev tools. This
panel visualizes the web audio graph in real-time and lets users inspect nodes.

## Install and run.

Just load the `extension` directory as an
[unpacked Chrome extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).

## Set up for development.

1. Set up [2-factor authentication for Github](https://github.com/blog/1614-two-factor-authentication)
(as Google requires).
2. Add this origin as a remote to your local git repo. Use the `git@` address. The `https` address does not work with 2-factor authentication.

Note that messages passed throughout the extension are documented in message-docs.md.
